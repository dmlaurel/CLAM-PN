# CLAM-PN

Closed Loop Additive Manufacturing - Petri Nets

CLAM-PN seeks to use the Petri Net concept from the field of Discrete Event Systems to model the behavior of a CLAM system, and evaluate the reachability of various structures that could be printed.

The CLAM concept, which I hope to explore in more depth in later work, is derived from the research done by the "Creative Machines Lab" at Columbia University on "cellular machines". The CLAM system consists of depositing layers of 3D "cells" that are bonded together to form a lattice structure, rather than continuously printing material as is done in traditional 3D printing. These layers can have gaps, which are left intentionally to influence properties of the resulting object, such as density, pliability, and permeability. The aim of my work in CLAM-PN is to design a system to evaluate which CLAM lattice structures would be feasible based on a variable set of constraints. While I will not explore every type of constraint structure, I hope that this work will serve as an infrastrucutre for easily modeling future constraints.
